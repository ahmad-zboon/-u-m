#### Willingness to change 
Preparedness and the ability to change are among the most important ways that lead to a personâ€™s growth and advancement for the better in life. [1] It is worth noting that a person can change himself by:
- Begin with self-love and accept it as it is, with all its emotional and physical characteristics. 
- Stop criticizing oneself, and forgive the slips and mistakes it has made, because humans are sinful by nature. 
- Self-love and development for the better by surrounding oneself with people who are dear to the heart and who offer help. And they love the best for others .
- Perception of negative traits and traits in the soul and work to get rid of them and change them into positive ones and traits.
